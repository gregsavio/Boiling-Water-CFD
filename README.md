# Boiling-Water-CFD
Here is one of the projects I worked on for the Fluid Dynamics course. The case involved simulating the boiling water process in a closed copper vessel, with the bottom part of the system acting as a heater and the top part as a condenser. Here are the results of the simulation. A more detailed explanation can be found in the attached PowerPoint presentation.
